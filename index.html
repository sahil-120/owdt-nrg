                    <h4 class="title">Widening Customer Appeal.</h4>
                    <p>The NRG Group approached OWDT to address their digital presence and allow us to offer design
                        recommendations for a new website. A significant reason they were interested in revamping their
                        current
                        website was that it failed to depict a lively, vibrant setting – the backdrop for the endless
                        variety of
                        events that place at their venues. They viewed their website as too static and lifeless.
                    </p>
                    <p>NRG Park was perceived mainly as a sporting event venue. It was important to expand this image
                        into a
                        venue brand that hosts a diverse range of entertainment events and experiences, widening the
                        audience
                        demographics. One of our visual challenges for the existing site was an inability to showcase
                        and
                        arrange upcoming events in a clear and immediate fashion. The overall design did not communicate
                        the
                        bustling energy that revolved around the parks, along with a design that hindered horizontal
                        user
                        growth.

                <h4 class="title">Insights</h4>
                <p>We had to partner with NRG Park’s internal marketing team and arrange a series of insight discovery
                    sessions to learn more about the venue’s brand strategy. Pairing our discovery session with live
                    user experience observations, we realized the goal was to streamline the navigational journey so
                    that a user from any demographic or location profile could navigate the site’s events and options
                    with ease.</p>

                <h4 class="title">Strategies</h4>
                <p>To implement this, we recommended developing a dynamic and interactive event page to showcase
                    upcoming events and their corresponding user options which also simplified the process of in-house
                    event management. We also found that user engagement levels were lower on various social media
                    channels. To address these findings, we suggested creating an aggregated social media page that
                    combined NRG Park’s accounts.</p>

                <p>We also envisioned a dynamic FAQ page to accommodate users to easily find answers to their questions.
                    In the event answered are not provided in the FAQ, users could submit questions using our
                    intelligent web-application that are compiled, sent to admins to respond to, then organized and

                <h4 class="title">Tactics & Execution</h4>
                <p>OWDT had to design a site that could appeal to 5.6 million visitors, and we did. We captured the
                    experiences taking place at their five facilities with visual appeal, user-centric design, and
                    content organization while expressing the iconic brand. An artistic showcase was developed using the
                    Interactive Modular Navigation Blocks (IMNB), the focal experience for users to navigate the website
                    with ease. We also developed the Modular Event Display Tool (MEDT) for browsing upcoming events and
                    exploring options to purchase tickets, find directions, add events to calendars, and sharing options
                    for social media accounts. NRG Park’s social media pages were combined and integrated into the new
                    design. And to manage the new deliverables, OWDT coded the functions into the CMS, so that
                    regardless of technical knowledge, the marketing team could manage content self-sufficiently.</p>

                <h4 class="title">Results & Market Share</h4>
                <p>Websites are a powerful medium to impress and attract customers. This was also true for NRG Park
                    after we gave the existing site an aesthetic and functional makeover. The style in which we
                    showcased five different facilities using SVG animations was a microcosm of the artistic direction.
                    The sum effect of the functional artistry was an increase in applications requesting to reserve
                    venues. The diversity of types of events also grew. This has attracted more events to Houston,
                    introducing further revenue to NRG Park and the local economy. NRG Park hosted the Super Bowl soon
                    after.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cols-6">
                <h4 class="title">Business Building</h4>
                <p>The new website reaffirmed NRG Park’s standing as Houston’s iconic venue for hosting world-class
                    games and events. It’s difficult to find a top brand without a top-tier digital presentation that
                    supports and conveys the internal and external principles of its operation and management. Reducing
                    the steps and increasing time spent during the user journey allowed vendors to make reservations
                    with greater ease, leaving a positive experience and resulting in higher overall user satisfaction.
                    The new website has increased bookings and set the stage for future developments for the NRG Park
                    brand.</p>
